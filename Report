When the code is run, the output shown is exactly what's on the first picture (0), i.e It prints out the available
options which are Help and See firmware version.When Help is chosen, it immediately shows 3 more options;
Blink led, press button and press zero to go back to the options.And last but not least, if option 2, which is see firmware version
happens to be chosen according to picture 2, It prints the version.
